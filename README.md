# Sales-Performance-Optimization

In this project, I have the role of a data analyst for the Chinook Music Store. Our stakeholders want to know the following:

1. Which albums that should be added to the store based on a newly signed deal with a record label and an analysis of the best selling albums in the US.
2. If any sales support agent is performing better and to identify relevant information on the top sales.
3. Finally the store want me to identify possibilities in the global market based on the:
* total number of customers
* total value of sales
* average value of sales per customer
* average order value

To answer these questions I will join multiple tables from an SQL database containing information about the sales. The database is provided as an SQLite database file called chinook.db. A schematic overview of the database tables and content can be found here: https://s3.amazonaws.com/dq-content/190/chinook-schema.svg.

The most important findings from this analysis:

1. Based on the total sales in the USA, the campaign should focus on the following artists: Red Tone (Punk), Meteor and the Girls (Pop) and Slim Jim Bites (Blues). Furthermore it should be noted that the 'rock' genre is by far the best performing genre accounting for 53% of the total sales in the USA.
2. Each employee seems to have a niche where they perform a major part of their sale. The analysis shows that the second highest contributor to the total sale has a very niche top genre. This could indicate a potential opportunity to increase sales in other niches by hiring support agents with a keen knowledge about other music genres.
3. Based on the data, there may be opportunity to increase sales in the following European countries:
* Czech Republic
* United Kingdom
* Portugal

A good approach would be to run small campaigns in these countries, collecting and analyzing the purchases of new customers to make sure that these trends are confirmed.
